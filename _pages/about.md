 My name is Su Lingjie(苏凌杰), a third-year master's student at the State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Manufacturing Equipment and Technology at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). I previously earned my bachlor's degree from the School of Mechanical Science and Engineering at HUST. My research focuses on point software development for monitoring architecture construction and 3D computer vision. <br><br>

<strong>Algorithm Theory</strong>: The mathematical theory in my research includs optimization theory, statistics (especially Gaussian Mixture Model and EM algorithm), matrix theory, iterative solution methods and preconditioning of linear functions, and bilateral filtering method. <br><br>

<strong>Algorithm Application</strong>: These designed algorithms can be used for pose estimation, construction monitoring, and visualization.

I once served as a teaching assistant for a robotics measurement course during the summer exchange program (Global HUST) at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. My responsibilities included explaining the principles and operational procedures of robotic control, the imaging theory and usage of 3D scanners, and the algorithm of point cloud registration to eight exchange students from France, as well as guiding them in completing robotic measurement experiments.
